#NJ Transit MyBusNow.

Simple python script that parses the mybusnow HTML page, and captures the info to elasticsearch. 
The idea is to identify which is the best bus to catch in the morning when you are getting late for work. Will try plotting this data for 3-6 months and see if I can draw a pattern and generate any useful info from it. 
  
Thinking to add more reference points, where I can add PABT bus alerts or traffic alerts for the route I'm checking. 
  
As of now the code is very specific to my bus and my bus's route, if you are interested, then you can fork and modify for your buses. 

## Bus Stops Being Monitored

```
12648, 12655, 13371, 12049, 12070, 12046, 12067, 11787, 11791, 31858
```

  
The code is run on RaspberryPi (Model B - 512MB), as part of a cron job.   

## Installation

Since we want things to be fast, we use lxml as the html parser

``` 
 $ pip install beautifulsoup4
 $ pip install lxml
 $ pip install elasticsearch
```

You have to install Elasticsearch on your local n/w and persist data to that.

### lxml 

pip lxml might not work on raspberry pi, in that case use the installation from apt-get 

```
 $ sudo apt-get install python-lxml
```


## Cron Configuration

First bus on my route is at 5:12 am, so the cron job is supposed to run every minute from 5am to 11am, with a 1 second 
sleep between each stop, if I get banned will move it up to 3-5 seconds with a random in middle. 

### Add job to crontab

```
crontab -e
```

Add this line (if you need to know about the cron job pattern, then man it)

```
*/1 5-11 * * * /path/to/python file
```

### Debugging Cron Jobs
Cron jobs are not always working as expected, and we spend some time trying to figure why they are not working, here is a very useful link on the askubuntu forums about it. 

http://askubuntu.com/questions/23009/reasons-why-crontab-does-not-work 

Read thru the link before getting frustrated and trying to figure why a certain configuration is not working.


## Elasticsearch
Will create an ES index per month, if the data gets too huge, then might move it to a smaller set.
Also the shard count is set to 1 for now. ES is installed on Raspberry Pi I'm not going to detail that, please google on how to set that up.

### Delay in starting up
ES take some time to startup, it is not as snappy as a desktop. If you do a restart, it'll take a few minutes (3-5 minutes) for the server to be made available. Review your logs to check if the server is up.

## TODO 

Convert this script to AWS Kinesis & DynamoDB.
